# Upgrading NFTs

The upgrade settings page is very simple. You can start, end, or restart your upgrade page. When navigating to the page and clicking the "I am ready to start!" button, it should look like this:

![Upgrade Settings End](/img/upgrade-projects/create-upgrade-project/upgrade-settings/upgrade-settings-end.png)

At any time you can end the Upgrade Project if you want to make changes and restart it later! With the upgrade project started, we will now learn in the next section how your supporters can upgrade their NFTs!
