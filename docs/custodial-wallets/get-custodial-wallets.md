# Get Custodial Wallet

After you have created a custodial wallet or wallets, we can retrieve those wallets with the 2 APIs. We have the **getCustodialWallet** graphQL query and the **getCustodialWallets** graphQL query that we can use. The **getCustodialWallets** is paginated, so if you have hundreds of wallets you can fetch those easily.

The code is available in the [Saturn Integration Library](https://github.com/Orion-Crypto/Saturn-V2-Integration), but no UI component is currently in the library.
