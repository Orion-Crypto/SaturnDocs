# Delete Custodial Wallet

If we have created a custodial wallet with our API, and want to delete the wallet, we can delete it with the **deleteCustodialWallet** graphQL mutation.

![Saturn Integration Cutodial Wallet API](/img/custodial-wallets/delete-custodial-wallet/delete-custodial-wallet-api.png)

The code is available in the [Saturn Integration Library](https://github.com/Orion-Crypto/Saturn-V2-Integration), but no UI component is currently in the library.
