# Mint Settings

The mint settings page allows us to do 2 things with our Token Project:

-   **Mint Tokens**
-   **Burn Tokens**

## Deploy Contract

Before minting or burning can begin, you need to deploy the minting smart contract on the cardano blockchain. By clicking "Deploy Contract" you will be asked to sign a transaction that will put the smart contract on the blockchain at a specific transaction hash and transaction index so it can be found for future use.

Note: The "Smart Contract Settings" in the box below shows you which address the smart contracts we are using are located at on the Cardano blockchain.

After clicking the yellow "Mint Token" button we will now be asked to confirm the tokens we want to mint as well as the amount of tokens. Lets leave everything as is and click the yellow "Mint Tokens" button.

After clicking this button we must sign the transactions and then we have successfully minted tokens!

## Burn Tokens

Finally, now that we have minted some tokens and they are in our wallet, lets burn the tokens to showcase how that works.

In the "Select Mint Type" box, click "Token Burn". Similarly to minting tokens,
