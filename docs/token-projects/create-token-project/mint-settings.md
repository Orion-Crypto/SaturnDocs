# Mint Settings

The mint settings page allows us to do 2 things with our Token Project:

-   **Mint Tokens**
-   **Burn Tokens**

## Deploy Contract

Before minting or burning can begin, you need to deploy the minting smart contract on the cardano blockchain. By clicking "Deploy Contract" you will be asked to sign a transaction that will put the smart contract on the blockchain at a specific transaction hash and transaction index so it can be found for future use.
