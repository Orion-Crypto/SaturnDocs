# Swap NFTs

Now that we have gone over how to create your Wormhole Project it's time to showcase how your supporters can swap their NFTs for your NFTs using the wormhole! Using the link provided in your "Wormhole Settings" page your supporters can reach the swap page that should look similar to this:

In order for users to swap thier NFTs, a user must:

-   Connect their wallet by hovering over the "Connect Wallet" button and selecting the wallet they want to pay with.
-   Have of of the NFTs from the old policy Id and select it in the list.
-   Click the "Convert NFTs!" button
-   Sign the wormhole transaction

After a support has done the above steps they will be greeted with a success screen and a random NFT from your project will be minted to their wallet!
