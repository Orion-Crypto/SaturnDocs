# Wormhole Data

The **Wormhole Data** page allows you to update data related to the overall project:

-   Update the collection name.
-   Update the price per nft of your collection (in **Ada** or any **Cardano Native Asset**).
-   Updating the lock date / Policy Id for your collection.
-   Update the royalty data of your collection.

As you can see, this is identical to the [NFT Project Data](/docs/nft-projects/create-nft-project/nft-project-data.md) page.

However, you can alter the NFT data by clicking on each individual NFT and following the same steps as in the [NFTs Page](/docs/nft-projects/create-nft-project/nfts-page.md) guide.

In this case, since I only minted 4 NFTs from the project (you may have minted less or more) I only see 4 NFTs in my user interface. IN the next section we will go over the "Wormhole Data"
