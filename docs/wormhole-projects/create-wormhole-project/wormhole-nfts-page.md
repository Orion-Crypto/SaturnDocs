# Wormhole NFTs

The **Wormhole NFTs** page shows you all the information about the nfts currently in the project. Because the wormhole is meant to mimic an existing NFT project, you cannot and should not add or remove NFTs.

However, you can alter the NFT data by clicking on each individual NFT and following the same steps as in the [NFTs Page](/docs/nft-projects/create-nft-project/nfts-page.md) guide.

In this case, since I only minted 4 NFTs from the project (you may have minted less or more) I only see 4 NFTs in my user interface. IN the next section we will go over the "Wormhole Data"
