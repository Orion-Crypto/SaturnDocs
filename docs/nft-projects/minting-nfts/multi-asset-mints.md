# Multi Asset Payments

Now we will show you how supports can mint NFTs using any Cardano Native Asset as payment. As detailed in the [nft project data](/docs/nft-projects//create-nft-project/project-data.md) page, we first need to set up our advanced pricing. In this case we will show an example using the Ape Society's **$SOC** token.

With our advanced pricing setup and saved, when supporters visit the mint page, it will now look like this:

![Price choice 1](/img/nft-projects/mint-nfts/multi-asset-mints/price-choice-1.png)

After a user selects to pay with Society and click the "Mint NFT!" button, the screen will look like this. This is a bit different then before. As you can see with the -1 Asset and +1 Asset in the wallet tab, 100 Society assets are leaving the wallet and 1 NFT is going into the wallet.

Congratulations! We have now minting an NFT using a Cardano Native Asset as payment! All Cardano Native Assets are supported such as stable coins or game assets!
