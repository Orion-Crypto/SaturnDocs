# NFTs Page

The **NFTs** page has everything you need to manage your project. On this page you can:

-   Add NFTs to your project
-   Delete NFTs from your project
-   Automatically rename all the nfts in your collection
-   Download all the metadata associated with your collection

## Add Your First NFT

In these next few sections we will:

-   Add an NFT to our project
-   Upload an image for our NFT
-   Update all the data associated with the NFT

First, we will add an NFT to our project by clicking the "Add NFTs" Button

![Add NFT](/img/nft-projects/nfts-page/add-nft.png)

Clicking on the edit button in this new NFT will bring us to this screen where we can edit all of the data associated with the NFT

<div class="flex justify-between mb-12">
  <img src="/img/nft-projects/nfts-page/update-nft-1.png" class="w-12/25" />
  <img src="/img/nft-projects/nfts-page/update-nft-2.png" class="w-12/25" />
</div>

## Uploading An Image

NFTs can be text files, images, gifs, or even video. For our first NFT, we will upload this adorable blob image.

<img src="/img/nft-projects/nfts-page/blob.png" class="w-1/5" />

Right click the image above and select "Save image as..." to save the image to your computer. Now click on the "Select File(s)" button to upload the blob image to the Saturn site. Your Policy Id will look different from the image below but, here is what your site should look like after uploading.

## Uploading NFT Data

We have 6 pieces of data that we need to have on our NFT. These are:

-   Policy Id: This is string of 56 hexidecimals characters that group the NFTs in our NFT project together on the Cardano Blockchain.
-   Asset Name: This is the blockchain name for our asset
