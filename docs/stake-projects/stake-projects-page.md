You can unselect the projects by clicking on them again, or clicking the **Deselect Stake Projects** button

## **Deleting a project**

By pressing the **"Delete"** button while one, or many projects are selected, the project will be deleted. Be careful, as these projects will **not** be recoverable

## **Searching a project**

The search bar to the right of the **Select NFT Projects** page allows you to search for a specific project by name.
