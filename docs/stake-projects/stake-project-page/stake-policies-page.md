# Stake Policies Page

The **Extra Policies** page is where you can assign extra policies to your stake project. 

![Stake Policies screen](/img/stake-projects/stake-policies-page/stake-policies-page-01.png)

This means you can allow people to stake NFT's for a **different NFT project** in addition to your main project, and you can also set how many daily tokens those kinds of NFT's earn. 

### Adding an extra policy

You can click the **Add Policy** button to create a new slot where you can enter an extra policy id into your stake project.

## Policy Id: 

This field is where you put the policy id of the nft project you want to add to your stake project

## Daily Token Reward: 

This number is the number of tokens an nft of this policy id will earn daily if staked. 

For example, if this value is "5" and the policy id is **dac355946b4317530d9ec0cb142c63a4b624610786c2a32137d78e25**, then a staked NFT with this policy id will earn 5 tokens a day.

You can add as many Policy Id's as needed to your stake sroject and assign the amount of tokens distributed daily for each of them.
