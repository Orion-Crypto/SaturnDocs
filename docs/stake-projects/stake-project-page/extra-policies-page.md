# Stake Project Page

The **Stake Projects** page is the first stop when creating your Stake project. Here you can create new projects or delete old ones.

## User Interface

The Extra Policies page is where you can assign extra policies to your stake project. 

This means you can allow people to stake NFT's for a different project as well as your main project, as well as set how many daily tokens those kinds of NFT's earn. 

*Adding an extra policy*

You can click the "Add Policy" button to create a new slot where you can enter an extra policy id into your stake project. 

Policy Id: 

This field is where you put the policy id of the nft project you want to add to your stake project

Daily Token Reward: 

This number is the number of tokens an nft of this policy id will earn daily if staked. 

I.e. if this value is "5" and the policy id is "123", then a staked NFT with this policy id will earn 5 tokens a day
