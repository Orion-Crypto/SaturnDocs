# Saturn API

## API Documentation

Saturn uses a modern [GraphQL API](https://api.saturnnft.io/v2/graphql) for a simple developer experience implementing the interface on any front ends you build.

## Saturn Integration Library

Reading raw API documentation can be daunting, and there are still elements on Cardano that need to be implemented such as Wallet Connect. With this, we have created a sample [Saturn Integration Library](https://github.com/Orion-Crypto/Saturn-V2-Integration) front end that fully implements the Saturn GraphQL API. You can copy and paste a large chunk of the code in this repository to quickly create any NFT / Smart Contact project you want!

## Discord Server

If you have any further questions, or need support with the [API Documentation](https://api.saturnnft.io/v2/graphql) or the [Saturn Integration Library](https://github.com/Orion-Crypto/Saturn-V2-Integration), we have the [Saturn Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NvVNfQmPjp) to ask any questions that you have!
